  Mission 9 Assessment Pool

  This file contains assessment-ready questions only.

  The assessment itself should select a smaller randomized set
  from this pool when Mission 9 starts.

  Important:
  - Teaching cards are excluded.
  - Introduction cards are excluded.
  - Drag-and-drop sorting is excluded because that interaction
    does not use the normal assessment answer recorder.
  - Two-property click-based classification remains eligible.
